Title- Implementation of Naive Bayes algorithm

Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm, which uses Bayes theorem of probability for prediction of unknown class. It uses probability to decide which class a test point belongs to. Naive Bayes is a purely statistical model. This algorithm is called Naive due to the assumption that the features/ attributes in the datasets are mutually independent.

For the demonstration, I used the Pima indian diabetes dataset. The data is available at Kaggle and can be downloaded from here. The datasets nine columns: Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age and Outcome. The first eight are features and the last one ( Outcome) is the label. Outcome has two types of labels 0 (Non-Diabetic) and 1 (Diabetic).


In this,I applied Naive Bayes classification algorithm to predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not. To evaluate the model I have used accuracy and classification report generated using sklearn.
